# Fake Products API with serverless functions

This is just a testing project example of netlify serverless functions feature

## Demo

Navigate to `https://fake-products-api.netlify.app/` and open your developer tools.
Click on different buttons and you should see and the responses of data on console.


## Testing locally

```bash
npm install

npm run netlify:dev
```

## Notes
I also tested that putting files in, for example `assets` folder, they are served publicly.
